# Welding Shop App - Current Status

## What's Working:
- ✅ React app created with Vite
- ✅ Basic app structure with Dashboard, Customers, and Jobs tabs
- ✅ App is running on http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Navigation between tabs works
- ⚠️ Tailwind CSS installed but not applying styles correctly
- ✅ Using inline styles as temporary solution

## Project Location:
C:\Users\Jarrod\Desktop\welding-shop-app

## Current Files:
- src/App.jsx - Main app with inline styles (no Tailwind)
- src/index.css - Has Tailwind directives
- tailwind.config.js - Configured with custom colors
- postcss.config.js - Standard config

## Next Steps:
1. Fix Tailwind CSS styling issue
2. Add Supabase integration
3. Build out features: Quote builder, Inventory, Invoices
4. Add real data persistence

## Supabase Status:
- Tables created in Supabase
- API keys ready to use
- Not yet integrated into app
